Glossary of terms:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   [TBC]   : to be confirmed
   [TBD]   : to be defined
   S.N.    : Serial Number

   b(i)    : bit i
   b(i..j) : bits from i to j (if i>j then area is read in reverse)
   B(I)    : byte I
   B(I..J) : bytes from I to J (if I>J then area is read in reverse)
   x^y     : x at the power y  (in mathematical expresssions)

   Serial Number: Unique number assigned to a chip, this number  is  programmed
                  in the chip by the manufacturer, you can not change it. A few
                  cards don't have a serial number. A copy of the serial number
                  is sometimes printed on the card itself.

   Checksum     : Checksums are used in order to verify if the header of a card
                  is not altered. One byte a the header  is  computed  using  a
                  simple formula (ie: for a bit set  to  '1'  in  bytes 1, 2, 3
                  substract 4 to the value 227, you must obtain  the  value set
                  in byte 0 of the card). You  can  use  these  checksums  (and
                  other bits in the header area) to check if a  card  is  of  a
                  given type. This document is intended to help you doing so.

   Certificate  : Certificates are used in 2nd generation telecards  to  verify
                  if a card is not a fake one. Certificates are 16  or  32 bits 
                  long and  are  calculated  using  a  one  way  function  (each
                  operator has his own), a secret key (operator dependent)  and
                  the value of the bits contained in the  header  of  the card.
                  Because the function and the key are kept  secret  you  can't
                  compute a certificate by yourself, nor you can't  use  it  to
                  check if the card is of a  given  type.  In  order  to  avoid
                  hackers doing crypto-analysis against  certificates  using  a
                  big number of cards, it can be erased when the card is empty.
                  Writting to this area may invalidate the card.

   Counter/Unit : This area contains the number of units remaining (or used) on
      Area        the card. It is designed so you can not increase the value of
                  the card. How this area works (decoding and writing)  depends
                  on the card's type. This document will help you in  determing
                  the remaining credit of a card.


   Anti-tearing : Anti-tearing flags (also known as pull-out flags) are used in
                  order to ensure that the holder of the card  does  not  loose
                  units (money) if he removes the  card  during  an  operation.
                  Anti-tearing flags are  written  when  the  counter  area  is
                  written to, they are erased when the operation is  completed.
                  If the card is  removed  during  the  operation  anti-tearing
                  are used to restore the counter area the next  time  you  use
                  the card.

Authentification: Authentification is used  in 2nd  generation  telecards,  the 
                  reader sends a random  sequence  called  'challenge'  to  the
                  card, this challenge is used by the card to compute an answer
                  wich is sent back to the reader. If  the  answer  is  correct
                  the the reader can assume that the card is a 'good' one.

I ) The 1st generation Telecards:
    ============================

   1.1 - Introduction:
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Since the middle of 80's have appeared a new generation of cards  ( the
smart-cards  or  chip cards )  that have  replaced most of the magnetics cards
applications  notably  for  telecom payement and  also for credit cards. These
cards are far more secure than the magnetics cards, and there are several kind
of  cards following  the application.  The simplier ones are the Simple Memory
cards  like the  one used as  Telecard  for the telecom payement in the public
phone-booths  ( Generaly all the memory content is  readable,  and there  is a
maker-area that is unwritable ) , then there are  more sofisticated  cards:
Memory Cards with some area read protected by a key, these cards  can  contain
some  private informations in  the read-protected area.   At the end there are
microprocessor-cards (cards working following the ISO-7816 protocol), that are
the safiest ones  since these cards  have their own internal  Operating System
that prevent  I/O  if the PIN (Personal Idenfication Number) has not been ent-
-ered in the cards before ( These cards are used  when confidentiality is
needed,  like in  credit cards (bank), crypted TV access cards, health cards,
SIM cards for GSM, etc ... ).


       About telecards, even if these cards are the less safe ones, don't think
that  you  are  going  to  phone freely for that, in fact no.  All the data are
readable since  there are  no confidential data inside, the cards are well done
enough to be  very secure for  the payement of telecom communications in public
booth.

       So, what is a phonecard exactly ? In fact generaly it's a 256 bits EPROM
( French like cards ),  or a 128 bits EEPROM (German like cards) with a  serial
output and some other control pins.

       Then why can it not be refilled ?   Well,  indeed to refill the card you
will  have to erase the cards with UV,  knowing that the cards is coated in  UV
opaqued resin that prevent  UV from reaching the silicium chip, and even if you
could  to erase the chip  you will have to program the manufactuer area that is
write-protected by a lock-out fuse that was fused after the card programming in
factory.

       Remember that a public booth contains a specialized computer and have  a
direct connexion to the public telephone network, and so to other computers. In
France public booths are connected to the telephone network using a  "Unite  de
raccordement de publiphone (URP)" which holds a "black list"  of  stolen,  fake
cards... A public booth first reads the card, checks if it seems OK (checksums,
certificates...), it asks the URP to check if the card is reported stolen or is
known as fake and then it allows you to dial a number.

       DO NOT FORGET: if you try to use a fake  card, the  public booth may let
you issue your call and the URP may alert the operator who may call the police.
Many people in France where jailed this way. SO NO QUESTIONS REGARDING CLONING,
RECHARGING... PHONECARDS WILL BE ANSWERED AS IT IS ILLEGAL AND MAY BE VERY  BAD
FOR YOUR KARMA.

       Neithertheless it can be very interesting to study how these cards work,
to see  which kind of data are inside and  how the data are maped  inside or to
see  how many units are left  inside for exemple.  Besides  there  are a  great
number of  applications of  these cards when there  are used (only for personal
use of course) , since  you can use them as key to open a door, or you can also
use them as key to secure a program, etc ....

       French Telecards have been created in 1984 and at this time constructors
decided to build these cards in NMOS technology  but  now,  France Telecom  has
changed all the readers in the public booths and use CMOS technology  for  70 %
of the cards currently being issued (07/1997).
 
       Also they plan to use EEPROM to secure the cards and to add many usefull
informations in, and you will perhaps use phone cards  to  buy  you  bread   or
anything else. Cards used for advertising may be programmed so the public booth
automatically call a given number when the card is inserted (a remplacement for
toll free number where advertiser can choose who  may  call  freely  and  where
user do not have to bother reminding a number).

       These cards are called Second Generation Telecards (T2G).

Reset:
------
  The address counter is reset to 0 when the clock line CLK is raised while
the control line R is high {Note that the address counter can not be reset
when it is in the range 0 to 7}.

   The address counter is incremented by 1 with each rising edge of the clock
signal Clk, for as long as the control line R remains low. The data held in
each addressed bit is output to I/O contact each time Clk falls. It is not
impossible to decrement the address counter, therefore to address an earlier
bit, the address counter must be reset then incremented to require value.


Write:
------
   All unwritten or erased bits in the address 64-104 can be unwritten to.
When a memory cell is unwritten, it is set to 0. The addressed cell is
unwritten to by the following sequence.

1- R is raised while Clk is low, to disable address counter increment for one
clock pulse.

2- Clk is then raised for a minimum of 10ms to write to the address bit.

When to write operation ends, and Clk falls, the address counter is unlocked,
and the content of the written cell, which is now 0, is output to I/O contact
if the operation is correct.
The next Clk pulse will increment the address by one, then the write sequence
can be repeated to write the next bit.

WriteCarry:
-----------

   A counter is erased by performing the WRITECARRY sequence on the stage of
the next highest weighing to that to be erased.

The writecarry sequence is as follows:

1 - Set the address counter to an unwritten bit in the next highest counter
stage to that to be erased.

2 - Increment is disabled on the following rising edge of R where Clk remains
low.

3 - Clk is then raised for a minimum of 10ms, while R is low, to write to the
next address bit.

4 - R is the raised again while Clk remains low to disable increment a second
time.

5 - Clk is the raised for a minimum of 1ms, while R is low, to write to the
addressed bit a second time, erasing the counter level immediately below that
the addressed bit.

NOTES: When memory is dumped, the address counter restarts at 000 when you
       reach address 511. Value for bits from 376 to 511 depends on the chip's
       version. At that date, 3 chip versions seem to exist.

       On the first version of the chip the certificate b(112..127) cannot be
       erased when the card is empty. Some payphones do not erase certificate
       and do not set B(12) to $FF when card is empty. 

       For 50u and 120u cards 9 units are set in factory, 14 units are set in
       factory for 5u and 25u cards.

       The User Defined Area b(320..375) can be defined as "not erasable".

       French T2G "Numero Unique" are some special cards: a defined number is
       automatically dialed when the card is inserted in a payphone. At this
       time only 5u cards are known to exist (but may be 25u will come?).

The automatically dialed number is stored b(96..127), it is stored in binary
and as a french national number (as dialed from France). The number must be
french number, because there is no room for the international prefix.

Example: $08E3248D represents the number "01 49 10 37 57".

Theses cards are special, because the dialed number is partially stored on the
certificate, so certificate is not used (does not matter because you may only
dial one number).

   2.7 - The Octal Counter:
         ------------------

   The counter area stores the card's units. Its initial value is specified by
the card issuer and is set during manufacturing.

   The counter area is divided into a 5 stage abacus counter, or 4 stage abacus
counter. Depending on the chip you may:
      - Write a bit set to '1' to change its value to '0' (Eurochip family).
      - Write a bit set to '0' to change its value to '1' (T2G family).

   The octal value of each stage is defined by the number of bits set to
'1' (Eurochip and French T2G from France Telecom) or '0' (French T2G derivates)
this stage value must be weighted by the coeficient 8^n (where n is among
[4..0] or [3..0]).

    Exemple (Eurochip or french T2G from France Telecom):
    -----------------------------------------------------
            5 stage octal unit counter with 15818 units.

                     Byte8      Byte9      Byte10     Byte11     Byte12
                     (c4096)    (c512)     (c64)      (c8)       (c1)

                    00000111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 00000001 - 00000011

             Value = 3*8^4   +  6*8^3   +  7*8^2   +  1*8^1   +  2*8^0
                   = 3*4096  +  6*512   +  7*64    +  1*8     +  2*1
            --------------------------------------------------------------
             TOTAL = 15818 Units

    Exemple (french T2G derivate):
    ------------------------------
            5 stage octal unit counter with 15818 units.

                     Byte8      Byte9      Byte10     Byte11     Byte12
                     (c4096)    (c512)     (c64)      (c8)       (c1)
            --------------------------------------------------------------
                    11111000 - 11000000 - 10000000 - 11111110 - 11111100
            --------------------------------------------------------------
                    (3)octal   (6)octal   (7)octal   (1)octal   (2)octal
            --------------------------------------------------------------
             Value = 3*8^4   +  6*8^3   +  7*8^2   +  1*8^1   +  2*8^0
                   = 3*4096  +  6*512   +  7*64    +  1*8     +  2*1
            --------------------------------------------------------------
             TOTAL = 15818 Units

   Two types of cards exist:
      - Cards who counts the remaining units (mainly eurochips and french
        T2G derivates)
      - Cards who counts the used units (mainly french T2G from France
        Telecom).

   For cards who count the used units you need to know the value of card
(to compute the remaining value of the card). You must be aware that a
given number of units are burned in factory (in order to test the card).

   Exemple: For a 120 units French Telecard from France Telecom
9 units are burned in factory, so a fully used card counts 129 Units.


Exemple of the WRITE and WRITECARRY sequences (Eurochip):

        ----------------------------------------------------
        00000111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 00000000 - 00000011
-1                                                        ^    WRITE(b102)
        00000111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 00000000 - 00000001
-1                                                         ^   WRITE(b103)
        00000111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 00000000 - 00000000
-1                             ^         ^          ^
        00000111 - 00111111 - 00111111 - 11111111 - 00000000 + WRITECARRY(b81)
        00000111 - 00111111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 11111111 + WRITECARRY(b88)
        00000111 - 00111111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 01111111 + WRITE(b96)
-1
        00000111 - 00111111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 00111111 + WRITE(b97)

        00000111 - 00111111 - 00111111 - 01111111 - 00011111 + WRITE(b98)

        Etc ....

Note that you can only decrease the counter and it is not authorised  to write
in the counter a value greater than the old value.

NB: In fact, most of the card units do not represent telecom units,  but money
units, for exemple in german cards each telecom unit represent 30 pfennigs.
